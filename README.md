An incomplete iOS 12 Jailbreak. For now it only runs the exploit, gets tfp0, gets ROOT, escapes the SandBox, writes a test file to prove the sandbox was escaped then resprings. Feel free to build on top of it as long as you respect the GPLv3 license.

Older (4K) devices are not supported for now. 16K devices are A12 is experimental - may not work..
